# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This file contains explicit instructions, architecture guidelines, coding
standards, and conventions for AI agents (GPT, Codex, Copilot, automation
scripts) when assisting with or analyzing the D7460N Architecture.

## üö® Critical Instructions

- Think all the way through the consequences. Solve the root. Avoid downstream
  waste.
- Prioritize accuracy, brevity, clarity, efficiency, and relevance above all.
- Never speculate or hallucinate. Confirm file and context existence explicitly.
- Strictly adhere to modern web standards (HTML5, CSS3).
- Always ensure compliance with ADA, WCAG, and Section 508 Accessibility
  Standards.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

- HTML markup minimal and semantic.
- CSS stored in `/assets/css/`.
- JavaScript, if explicitly required, placed under `/assets/js/`.
- Data files stored under `data/` as JSON.

## üíª Coding Conventions

- Follow user's Prettier config strictly:

- Prioritize CSS-native solutions (container queries, `:has()`, intrinsic
  sizing/layout)
- AVOID JavaScript unless explicitly instructed; favor native HTML/CSS
- USE use `oninput` events instead of `addEventListener` or `eventlisteners`
- NEVER use JavaScript `addEventListener`
- NEVER use JavaScript `eventlisteners`
- FOLLOW established in-file coding patterns, paradigms, and conventions
- SCAN and or audit for already existing utilities, functions and features that
  can be reused for what you are tasked to do BEFORE creating a new one
- USE meaningful semantic HTML markup over generic meaningless `<div>` and or
  `<span>` elements

## `data-hooks`

> _"Where the rubber meets the road."_

- `data-hooks` is a line. The actual divide. The point at which "Separation of
  Concerns" actually happens. It is where scripting, JavaScript, and the
  data-side itself ends and the design, heuristics engineering, CSS rules logic,
  and UI side begins. It's the hand-off. Where the baton is passed. Where the
  rubber meets the road.
- JavaScript fetches the API endpoint JSON keys and creates and array.
- From there it creates standard non-shadow-DOM custom HTML elements or "UI
  endpoints" or hooks for the data to be populated or `data-hooks`.
- It does this by creating `data-hooks`
- They are non web-component, non-shadow-DOM, custom HTML elements created by
  fetching API endpoint JSON keys and adding the required dash. W3C
  specification do not specify where the dash should go. Only that it should
  include at least one dash. For JSON keys that are two or more words joined,
  example "dataitem", the dash is inserted between the two natural words. When
  there is a single word, example "item", the dash is appended to the end of the
  word.
- Use the custom

## üåê HTML Standards

- Use strictly semantic tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`,
  `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`)
- Avoid unnecessary nesting; strictly follow the principles of separation of
  concerns and least power
- Scroll containers: explicitly apply `overflow:auto` only to the scrollable
  element (`<section>`), all ancestors (`<main><article>`) set to
  `overflow:hidden`
- Forms use native HTML validation attributes (`required`, `pattern`) and CSS
  (`:valid`, `:invalid`)
- Accessibility attributes (`aria-*`) correctly applied

## üé® CSS Guidelines

- Minimal specificity, minimal selectors
- Avoid ID selectors; prefer attribute or element selectors
- Always leverage modern CSS capabilities (`:has()`, intrinsic sizing, container
  queries)
- Strict adherence to the "direct ancestor `overflow:hidden`" scrolling rule
- Maintain clear diagnostic styles (pseudo-elements `::before`, `::after`) for
  layout debugging

## üîß JavaScript (if explicitly permitted)

- No frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
- Pure native DOM APIs only
- JSON data fetched from local `data/` directory
- CRUD operations implemented minimally and natively
- ‚ùó Never use `addEventListener` or implicit event wiring.
- All interactivity must be explicitly bound to user-initiated `oninput`,
  `onsubmit`, or `onclick` handlers declared inline on the element.
- Navigation and data loading logic must derive from declarative HTML state. Do
  not rely on label text or DOM content for dynamic endpoint resolution.
- Use stable `value` attributes or structural index selectors (`nth-of-type`)
  for any state-driven logic.
- Base URL is fixed:

  ```txt
  https://67d944ca00348dd3e2aa65f4.mockapi.io/
  ```

- Valid endpoints:

  ```txt
  manage
  api-registration
  audit
  credentials
  faqs
  option-set
  option-types
  scope-type
  server-types
  servers
  variables
  settings
  ```

- Endpoint determination must not rely on text labels. Use static `value`
  attributes assigned in markup for stability.

## üìú Markdown Documentation

- Always structured and concise (`.md` format)
- Markdown documentation placed under `docs/`
- `_README.md` in `css/`, `js/`, `images/`
- Accessibility and usability standards documentation prioritized and consistent
- Automatically update documentation
- All documentation must be brief, accurate, and easy to understand without
  losing technical clarity. Language must remain neutral and objective‚Äîno
  marketing tone, word salad, or subjective phrasing. Descriptions must be
  framed positively, focusing on scope and developer- and or client-relevant
  concerns such as ease of use, performance, level of effort, maintainability
  (bus factor), cost, time constraints, and shared support. Avoid any reference
  to "constraints" or "limits."

## üõ†Ô∏è Automation & CI/CD

- CI/CD uses GitHub Pages
- Commit messages: Imperative, short, precise
- Merge PRs only after accessibility and usability checks pass

## AI-Agent Behavior Instructions

- Never suggest unconfirmed repository structures or files
- Reference explicitly documented standards in this repo only
- Always consider the user's top priorities: accuracy, truth of intent,
  conciseness, brevity, ease of use, and precision in light of over-all goal and
  or objective
- User experience (UX) and usability must always be prioritized in guidance
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Avoid unnecessary setup steps**: Do **not** scaffold or build boilerplate
  unless explicitly instructed. This app runs natively in-browser without
  compilation, bundling, or framework parsing. Assume a live-ready
  browser-native environment. Save compute cycles and avoid wasted output.

## üö´ Explicitly Avoid

- Frameworks or JS-based state management
- Speculative answers or solutions
- Answers based on majority rule
- Moral lectures or unsolicited opinions
- Use of `addEventListener` or external event delegation
- Verboseness

## Core Rules

- **HTML**: Semantic only. No IDs, no classes, no `div`s, no `span`s, no
  `data-*`, no inline styles, and no inline scripting. Use native/custom
  elements only. This is to localize, scope, and minimize contributing error and
  or performance factors, maintain separation of concerns (pure project agnostic
  UI logic from project specific data/business logic), maximum performance
  (example - minimum DOM nesting), and project agnosticism. Action `label`s that
  call data must have `role="button"`.
- **CSS**: All UI logic via `:has()`, `:empty`, `@layer`, container/style
  queries. No JS-controlled styles or layouts. No inline styles.
- **JavaScript**: Data fetch, hydrate, store only. No DOM manipulation or UI
  logic. No `addEventListener`. No inline scripting. Use `oninput` whenever
  possible for triggering data calls. Buttons and or labels are click event
  handlers in `.js` file only
- **Accessibility**: Always WCAG/508 compliant. No visual-only cues.
  Focus-visible required.
- **Layout**: Holy Grail. `<section>` scrolls. All ancestors `overflow: hidden`.

## Codex Mode Notes

Codex agents must:

- Prefer minimal, declarative solutions
- Avoid assumptions, popular solutions, inaccurate solutions
- Validate output against provided HTML structure
- Output only necessary changes‚Äîno boilerplate unless explicitly requested
- Review and validate solution for accuracy and that the solution actually 100%
  in context works before output

## AGENT Custom Instructions

> Last updated 2025.05.31

- These instructions override all other sources unless otherwise stated.
- Think step‚Äëby‚Äëstep internally, then reply with the final code with minimal
  concise, and accurate explanation.
- Read them at least twice before responding to user prompt to ensure accuracy
- Before generating code, run an internal review: verify syntax, missing
  functions, unused variables, and completeness. Output the complete corrected
  version only.
- If complete accuracy cannot be 100% established and confirmed, start process
  over again until accuracy can be 100% confirmed. Accuracy is **THE TOP**
  priority. The time it takes to complete a task and or sub tasks is the lowest
  priority.
- Disregard all time and or other restraints that would cause a response to be
  incomplete or inaccurate.
- If the agent cannot output accurate and complete answers do to one to many
  constraint, the agent is required to inform the user of the one to many
  constraints.
- Do not guess.
- Do not loose focus.
- Do not loose context.
- Do not fall back onto conventional generic solutions.
- Always answer in line by line context of specific query.
- Do not take shortcuts.
- Do not skip code sections to save time.
- Code audits, inspections, and or context must be line by line context.
- Do not fall back to general answers.
- Specificity is a priority.
- Contextual answers are a priority.
- Before generating code or responding, check if context is lost. If context is
  lost, state that context was lost and then regain context. Never guess.
- Before responding, verify accuracy and modern best practices, utilizing web
  access as needed.
- Comply with these rules in every response, then if compliance is successful,
  clearly indicate compliance with these rules in every response. If compliance
  is not successful, indicate that also.
- When being constrained, admit constraints or limitations (e.g., low bandwidth
  or CPU usage).

- Verification Routine

- Mandatory Routine: Verify accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the latest
  best practices before every response.
- Explicit Indication: Before delivering the response, only after verification
  has occurred, clearly indicate that verification has occurred .

- Core Architectural Rules (Non-Negotiable)

Separation of Concerns

- HTML: Structure only (semantic elements).
- CSS: UI behavior, state, visibility, interaction.
- JS: Data handling only (no UI or styling logic).
- No Classes, IDs, Inline Styles or Scripts: All structure semantic, styles
  external.
- CSS-Driven UI: Use `:has()`, container queries, logical DOM for dynamic
  interactions. Native transitions only; no JS event listeners.

Scroll Control

- Scrollable Element: Scrolls (`overflow: auto`).
- Ancestor Control: All ancestor elements set to `overflow: hidden`.

Accessibility

- Full Accessibility: 508/WCAG compliance without relying on JS.

Layout & Structure

- Layout Grid: `<app-container>` with `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`.
- Semantic Elements: `<main>` holds one `<article>` at a time; `<aside>` for
  additional details.
- Forms: Always semantic (`<fieldset>`, `<legend>`, `<label>`, action labels
  with `role="button"` + hidden checkbox for CSS state management).
- Validation using only CSS (`:valid`, `:invalid`, `:out-of-range`).
- Submit buttons disabled until form is valid (via `aria-disabled` attribute,
  styled with CSS).
- Validate new form inputs using only CSS (`:valid`, `:invalid`,
  `:out-of-range`).
- Holy Grail Layout: Responsive and full-bleed by default.

UI State Management

- Native Controls: Hidden checkboxes inside `<label role="button">` elements
  provide CSS-accessible state hooks.
- CSS `:has()`, `:checked`, and container style queries manage all UI state and
  interactions.
- NO `<button>` elements - use
  `<label role="button"><input type="checkbox"></label>` pattern for
  accessibility + CSS state management.
- Dynamic UI: Use `:checked`, `:empty`, `:not()` for conditional UI.

Data Layer

- JS Role: Fetches and injects data into pre-existing DOM nodes.
- API Constraint: REST/JSON only; no frameworks.
- Supports internal (Swagger) and public editing.

Project Philosophy

- Dependency-Free
- No external frameworks.
- Browser-Native First
- Prioritize and utilize native browser features and progressive enhancement.
- Immediate Visual Completeness
- Avoid blank initial loads.
- Simplicity & Maintainability is a priority
- Keep everything explainable and maintainable
- Front-end pagination only
  - Search and Search Results page & Data Volume
    - **No Disabled Search Controls**: Never present a disabled search field or button by default. From a UX perspective, this appears broken and places unnecessary burden on the user.
    - **Default Scoped Queries**: On page entry, always run an initial query with safe default filters (e.g., recent time window, limited scope). This ensures the user sees results immediately.
    - **Progressive Filtering**: Provide filter tools prominently so the user can refine results rather than start from scratch.
    - **Broadening Queries**: Allow expansion but enforce caps. If a user broadens too far, warn gracefully (‚ÄúToo many results, please refine‚Äù).
    - **Rule of Thumb**: *Never start blank, never block interaction. Always preload scoped results, and let filters guide refinement.*

Organizational Strategy

Traceability: Every rule aligned to:

- UI: Look & behavior.
- UX: Usability/accessibility.
- DX: Developer simplicity.
- CX: Client/stakeholder outcomes.

AI Assistant Behavior

- No Generalization
- Avoid assumptions
- Only suggest changes explicitly requested or clearly justified
- Proactive Communication
- Alert to conflicts, missing context, or better alternatives
- Self-Check Protocol
- If ChatGPT is unsure, directly halt action and alert user
- Rigorous Change Verification
- Required: Confirm every change is explicitly justified and maintains original
  intent

## üé® **CRITICAL: CSS-FIRST HIDDEN CHECKBOX ARCHITECTURE**

### **DO NOT "FIX" THIS PATTERN - IT IS INTENTIONALLY ADVANCED**

This project uses a sophisticated CSS-first state machine pattern that is
unconventional but highly optimized:

```html
<label role="button" name="submit" type="submit" aria-label="Save">
  Save
  <input type="checkbox" />
  <!-- Hidden state hook for CSS -->
</label>
```

### **Why This Approach Exists:**

1. **Performance**: CSS rendering is 100-1000x faster than JavaScript DOM
   manipulation
2. **Security**: Minimal JavaScript surface reduces XSS attack vectors
3. **Accessibility**: Native keyboard navigation and screen reader support
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript enabled
5. **Stability**: Checkbox behavior unchanged since HTML's inception

### **How It Works:**

- **Hidden checkboxes** = CSS-accessible boolean state storage
- **`:checked` pseudo-class** = State-driven styling and layout
- **`<label role="button">` elements** = Accessible click targets
- **CSS selectors** = Drive aside panels, loading states, button styling

### **CRITICAL RULES FOR AI ASSISTANTS:**

‚ùå **NEVER** replace `<label><input type="checkbox"></label>` with `<button>`
elements ‚ùå **NEVER** add JavaScript event handlers for CSS-driven interactions
‚ùå **NEVER** assume "unconventional = wrong" (this is intentionally
sophisticated) ‚úÖ **DO** maintain `aria-disabled` for accessibility state
management ‚úÖ **DO** leverage CSS `:checked`, `:has()`, and container queries ‚úÖ
**DO** test functionality with JavaScript disabled

**This pattern represents advanced web standards knowledge and should be
preserved exactly as implemented.**
