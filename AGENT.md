# AGENT.md: Universal Agent Configuration File

_Category: Informational_ _Date: July 2025_

---

## 1. ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

This file gives any AI-powered coding agent a unified understanding of this
codebaseâ€”structure, commands, conventionsâ€”so you don't need scattered config
files.

**ðŸŽ¯ QUICK START FOR AI ASSISTANTS: Read `docs/PROJECT-STATE.md` first for
complete project understanding and current status.**

**D7460N** is a browser-native, fully declarative architecture for building
scalable, maintainable front-end systems. It follows JAMstack principles,
operates as a Single Page Application (SPA), and is implemented as a Progressive
Web App (PWA). It eliminates runtime dependencies and avoids JavaScript-driven
UI logic by embracing modern standards: semantic HTML, CSS state management, and
data-only JavaScript modules.

---

## 2. Project Structure & Organization

- Root: static entry point (HTML, CSS, JS); no server or CLI
- `assets/`: CSS only (D7460N-architected, UI via CSS)
- `src/`: data-processing code, no UI/event logic
- `tests/`: unit and integration tests

---

## 3. Build, Test & Development Commands

This project is built to run natively in the browser with no build steps,
bundlers, transpilers, or dependency managers. No NPM, no packages, and no
frameworks are used.

- Preview: Open `index.html` directly in any browser
- Testing: open each test HTML file in the browser; no external runner required
- Linting: run your preferred static analysis tool if needed

---

## 4. Code Style & Conventions

UI logic is handled entirely via CSS (e.g., `:has()`, `:checked`, `:empty`)

Structure is defined declaratively in HTML

JavaScript only handles pure data concerns

- **JS**: data-only, no UI/event code
- **CSS**: handles UI/state via `:has()`, container queries
- **HTML**: semantic structure only (`<app-container>`, `<nav>`, `<details>`,
  `<summary>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<form>`, `<fieldset>`)
- Tabs for code; 2 spaces for YAML/JSON/MD/HTML/CSS/JS
- Strict linting; no inline styles or JS event handlers, no event listeners

---

## 5. Architecture & Design Patterns

UI logic is handled entirely via CSS (e.g., `:has()`, `:checked`, `:empty`)

Structure is defined declaratively in HTML

JavaScript only handles pure data concerns

- Separation of concerns: HTML (structure), CSS (UI), JS (data)
- Scrollable content must use `overflow-y: auto;` ancestor elements
  `overflow: hidden;`
- Declarative, CSS-driven, human-triggered interactivity; no JS listeners
- Data fetch/manipulation/delivery only via JS; no framework or dependencies
- Form validation via HTML attributes and CSS pseudo-classes only
- Follow Least Power Principle - HTML first, CSS next, JS last (data only)

---

## 6. Code Style & Conventions

### HTML

- No inline classes, IDs, data-\*, styles, scripts, or data
- Structure-only: semantic elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<details>`,
  `<summary>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<form>`, `<fieldset>`, etc.)
- Inputs use attributes only; values injected from JS

### CSS

- UI logic via `:has()`, `:checked`, `:empty`, `@container`
- Form validation via `:valid`, `:invalid`, `:out-of-range`
- Scroll behavior: all scrollable elements have `overflow: auto;` ancestors
  `overflow: hidden;`
- Fallbacks handled using `::before` on missing structural elements

### JS

- Strict separation: JS never controls UI heuristics, behaviour, state, or
  styling
- Modules only fetch, transform, and inject data
- No event listeners for anything ever
- DOM mutation limited to whitelisted functions (`clearFieldset`,
  `removeInlineStyles`, etc.)
- Use named imports, avoid default exports
- AI-generated logic must check if existing functions and modules already handle
  the required functionality before implementing new logic
- Do not reimplement or duplicate logic that already exists across modules
- All JS modules must be self-contained and not rely on global state or side
  effects
- All JS modules must be idempotent and safe to run multiple times without
  unintended consequences
- All JS modules must be designed to work with the provided `schema.js` for data
  structure consistency
- All JS modules must be able to run in a browser environment without any
  external dependencies
- All agents, humans, and tools must read every JS module line-by-line before
  attempting any changes to ensure full context and architectural continuity
- Use `schema.js` to ensure data structure consistency across all JS modules
- Follow the schema-driven approach for all data transformations and injections
- Ensure all JS modules are self-contained and do not rely on global state or
  side effects
- Ensure all JS modules are designed to work in a browser environment without
  any external dependencies

---

## 7. Architecture & Design Patterns

- Holy Grail Layout via `<app-container>` using semantic regions
- Custom Elements generated from JSON keys using `toTagName()`
- Schema-driven DOM injection from schema.js
- Rules engine governs visibility, order, required fields
- Declarative form inputs: generated inside `<fieldset>` + native validation
- Fallbacks for missing content, not empty content
- Progressive enhancement: immediate visual completeness with no JS dependency
- No hardcoded data in HTML, CSS, or JS
- No inline styles, scripts, or event handlers in HTML
- No external dependencies, frameworks, or libraries
- No server-side rendering or dynamic content generation
- No build steps, bundlers, or transpilers
- No NPM, packages, or dependency managers
- No CLI commands or scripts
- No event listeners or handlers in JS
- No global state or side effects in JS
- No complex state management in JS

---

## 8. Testing Guidelines

- Unit tests cover JavaScript modules that handle data logic onlyâ€”no UI or event
  code is tested
- Integration tests to verify data flow and outputs
- No UI testing in JS; UI is CSS/HTML-onlyâ€”verify manually or via visual testing
  tools
- Use browser dev tools to inspect DOM structure and CSS styles
- Ensure all JS modules are idempotent and can be run multiple times without
  side effects
- Validate all data inputs in JS modules against `schema.js`

---

## 9. Security Considerations

- Must be able to work with JS turned off
- Must remain data-agnostic
- No sensitive data in code or config
- Validate all data inputs in JS modules
- Follow least-privilege principle in data handling

---

## 10. Configuration & Migration

- No configuration files; all settings are hardcoded in JS modules
- No migration scripts; all data is static and schema-driven
- No environment variables; all constants are defined in `config.js`
- No symlinks or external references; all files are self-contained
- No external dependencies; all code is self-contained and runs in the browser
- No CLI commands or scripts; all functionality is accessible via the browser
- No build steps, bundlers, or transpilers; all code is ready to run in the
  browser
- No server-side rendering or dynamic content generation; all content is static
  and schema-driven
- No external configuration files; all settings are hardcoded in JS `config.js`
- No external references; all files are self-contained and run in the browser

### JS

- `app.js` â€” Acts as the **main entry point** for initializing the UI. Imports
  `loaders.js` functions to fetch and render navigation, banners, and content.
  Calls `initApp()` on load to populate the UI based on the user's nav selection
  and settings. It does **NOT** define global event listeners or app-wide state.
  It does **NOT** manage form logic, error handling, or configuration mutation.
  It performs no DOM manipulation beyond selection and delegation to loader
  functions.
- `config.js` â€” Centralizes static configuration for API interaction and UI
  behavior. Defines base URLs, endpoint names, dropdown options, feature
  toggles, and JSON headers. Exposes global flags for warning modals and
  unsaved-change confirmations. It does **NOT** contain any logic, computation,
  or dynamic behavior. It does **NOT** modify or derive values at runtime. No
  dependency on external state or side effects.
- `env.js` â€” Detects the runtime environment (`dev`, `test`, `prod`) based on
  the hostname. Exports environment constants (`isDev`, `isTest`, `isProd`) for
  conditional logic. It does **NOT** fetch external settings or use cookies,
  query params, or localStorage. No environment-specific configuration is set
  hereâ€”only classification. It does **NOT** support override or manual toggling
  at runtime.
- `errors.js` â€” Exports a single `logError()` function to standardize error
  logging to the console. Accepts a context label and an optional error object.
  It does **NOT** define or return structured error objects. No integration with
  telemetry, UI messaging, or retry logic. No classification, codes, or severity
  levelsâ€”just raw console output.
- `fetch.js` â€” Provides wrapper functions for RESTful HTTP requests:
  `fetchJSON`, `postJSON`, `putJSON`, and `deleteJSON`. Normalizes endpoint
  formatting via `BASE_URL`. Validates response status and parses payloads (with
  an implicit parse check via `JSON.parse`). It does **NOT** retry, cache, or
  batch requests. Does **NOT** expose error messages beyond thrown status-based
  `Error()`. No timeout, abort handling, or schema validation on responses.
- `inject.js` â€” Creates and injects list items (`<li>`) into a `ul` based on
  JSON object data. Provides utility converters: `toTagName()` (for custom
  elements) and `toCamel()`. Manages row toggle state and synchronizes selected
  row with form field population. Binds a customizable `rowSelectHandler()` to
  respond to row selection.
- `loaders.js` â€” Orchestrates the loading and injection of banner, navigation,
  and page content. Applies schema normalization and rule inference to incoming
  data before injection. Maintains a cache of field rules per endpoint
  (`RULES_CACHE`) and exposes the active rule set. It does **NOT** manage UI
  state or stylingâ€”it only fetches, normalizes, and injects. Does **NOT**
  support pagination, filters, or incremental loading strategies. Lacks error
  retry or debounce/throttle mechanics on fetch operations.
- `rules.js` â€” Analyzes a list of records to infer UI field rules dynamically
  based on value patterns. Categorizes field types (`toggle`, `datetime`,
  `text`, `select`, `textarea`, `number`) using regex, value counts, and field
  names. Applies read-only or required flags based on field name or data
  completeness. It does **NOT** validate user input or enforce the rules at
  runtime. It doesn't support custom rule overrides or external schema
  injection. No support for nested fields, arrays, or deeply structured objects.
- `schema.js` â€” Provides field remapping dictionaries (`ENDPOINT_SCHEMAS`) to
  normalize API responses into a unified shape. Exposes `normalizeRecord()` to
  transform raw data using base and endpoint-specific mappings. Auto-generates
  reverse mappings to support serialization or form rendering from normalized
  keys. It does **NOT** enforce data types, required fields, or validation
  constraints. Schema rules are staticâ€”no dynamic or user-defined schema
  injection. No transformation of nested objects, only flat key remapping.
- `sw.js` â€” Registers a service worker to manage caching and offline behavior.
  Pre-caches critical static assets (HTML, CSS, JS, logo). Implements install,
  activate, and fetch handlers for offline-first behavior. It does **NOT**
  intercept dynamic API calls (e.g., POST/PUT). It does **NOT** include runtime
  caching strategies or version diffing. No push notification handling or
  background sync queue logic.
- `utils.js` â€” Provides stateless utility functions for form value tracking,
  date formatting, and normalization. Supports `hasUnsavedChanges()` and
  `unsavedCheck()` logic for tracking dirty form state and gating user actions.
  Includes helper formatting for keys (`normalizeKey`) and date strings
  (`formatDateForInput`). It does **NOT** mutate UI or interact with the DOM
  directly. No external dependencies, side effects, or application-specific
  logic. Does **NOT** persist or retrieve any stateâ€”fully functional and
  reactive.

### **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: CSS-First Hidden Checkbox Pattern**

**DO NOT "FIX" THIS - IT'S INTENTIONALLY ADVANCED:**

```html
<label role="button" name="submit" aria-label="Save">
  Save
  <input type="checkbox" />
  <!-- CSS state hook -->
</label>
```

**Why:** 100-1000x faster than JS, secure, accessible, works without JS
**Rules:** Never replace with `<button>`, never add JS event handlers **Read:**
`docs/PROJECT-STATE.md` for complete architecture explanation

Subdirectories (e.g., /admin/, /dashboard/) may include their own AGENT.md files
for localized subsystem documentation.
